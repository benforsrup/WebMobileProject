# Badplatser
The summer of 2018 was one of the hottest in modern history. Characterized by constant heat records and unmanageable forest fires, the weather also affected peopleâ€™s choice of outdoor activities and had many seek out public bathing places as a refuge from the blazing climate. There are many great public swimming places in Stockholm municipality but the information about them is often lackluster or poorly presented. This project aims to solve that problem by providing an app where people can easily find available swimming places in their area, get relevant information about them such as water temperature and also an indication of its popularity as rated by other visitors. This helps inform people of new swimming places and saves them the time and effort of going there themselves to see what the current conditions are like.

## How to run?

Clone the repo and install packages.
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:benforsrup/WebMobileProject.git
$ cd WebMobileProject
$ yarn
```

Since the project uses Firebase integration, the application requires a google-services.json file. See further details at https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup.

To run the iOS Project.
```shell
$ cd ios && pod install
$ cd .. && react-native run-ios
```

## How does the application work?

The application consists of 6 main screens:
- Login screen
- Sign-Up screen
- List of user-recommended badplatser
- Map of Stockholm with badplats-markers
- Detail screen about a certain badplats
- Profile and logout screen

These are created at the start of the application, in the file ```Navigation.js```. It calls ```registerScreens(store);```, which creates a wrapper component for each screen and injects a redux store into each component, as well as registers the component as a native screen. Furthermore, ```Navigation.js``` then creates the structure of the application, which is built using the API from [React Native Navigation](https://wix.github.io/react-native-navigation/#/). The first screen that is pushed to the screen is the Authentication Screen, which checks if a user is logged in, and if so redirects to the Search Tab (```ListScreen.js```).

### The three tabs files
- #### ```ListScreen.js```
This file listens to the Firestore collection and pushes that content to the redux store. Furthermore, it creates some listviews using React Native's Flatlist API. A searchbar is created using React Native Elements.

- #### ```MapScreen.js```
Renders the map component from ```Map.js```.
- #### ```ProfileScreen.js```
Displays the number of upvotes and favorites the user has, as well as handling the user signout process.
